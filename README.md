Budget tracker is a simple web app that runs online and offline to allow the user to add transactions that are tracked in a MongoDB database.

AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
